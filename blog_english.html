                            <p>


 <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-support/podcast.html" target="_blank"><i>Hackable, the Podcast.</i></a><br>
This podcast is about cybersecurity and how to protect yourself from criminals online.
<br>
<br>

You should keep in mind that the podcast is made by McAfee (a cybersecurity company) and that they promote their own software. Despite that, the podcast is pretty exciting because they often try to hack into their own colleagues or friends, to show how easy it can be to get hacked or phished. The podcast won the <a href="https://shortyawards.com/10th/hackable-podcast" target="_blank">best sponsored podcast “shorty award”</a> in 2018.
<br>
<br>
After listening to a few episodes I noticed that I opened my emails more carefully because basically any email could be a phishing attempt. I also notice that I am more cautious when trying to connect to a public WiFi network and that I now usually choose to just use my 4g data. 
<br>
<br>
One idea from the podcast that I find particularly interesting is that hacking is almost more of a psychological activity than a technological activity. For example, hackers use “social engineering” to gain the trust of their victims. They do this by first getting some information about their victims. This allows them to send an email with some personal information to impersonate someone or a company, and then gain their victim's trust. Then it is much easier for the hacker to deceive and mislead the victim. This form of phishing is called “targeted phishing”. Targeted phishing and social engineering are apparently often more convenient than trying to hack directly through a firewall, because an IT system is just as vulnerable as the most vulnerable part of the system, and often the most vulnerable parts of a system are the people.
<br>
<br>



<b>My current favorite episode:</b><br>
Episode Number 36 <i>GONE PHISHIN</i> from 12/03/19.
I found this episode fascinating because they showed how just by sending an email, a hacker (from a distance) could take complete control over someone's computer.<br>

I recommend this podcast, especially if you find it exciting to hear intense stories.
<br>
<br>
P.S.
<br>
<br>

If you want to know if you're being hacked, you can place 'honeypots' on your computer and in your cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, etc.). An example of a honeypot is a fake file that is attractive to hackers. For example, a Word document named "passwords.docx". Once that file is opened, you will receive an email notification. This works by placing digital tripwires, known as "Canary Tokens," in the document. Go to <a href=”https://canarytokens.org” target=”_blank”>canarytokens.org</a> to create Canary Tokens.

                            <p>

<br>
<i> Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins </i> by Peter Godfrey-Smith. <br>
This book was recommended to me by a friend that studies biology. It talks about different philosophies in an attempt to understand and decipher what consciousness really is. I always had the feeling that the author was tiptoeing around the topic without ever truly coming to a solid explanation of how in the world it’s possible that physical matter like human or octopus brains can possibly become self-aware and conscious. I had hoped that he would come up with a simple and clear answer for this, but unfortunately it looks like nobody can come up with a solution to this mystery. Nonetheless, it was truly fascinating to hear the author recount his many vivid stories about his interactions with octopuses. In his words, they are the closest thing to aliens or extraterrestrial intelligent life that we have encountered, since their brains evolved on a separate evolutionary path than humans. I recommend this book to anyone interested in thinking about what it means to be alive and aware. Some points of the book go into very intricate details about the anatomy and biology of octopuses and cephalopods, so if you find that boring you might have to be prepared to skip some portions of the book. <br>
Favorite quote: <br>

                            <p>This is the first of (hopefully) many to come blog posts. I have decided to make it a habit to write a blog post (at least) once a week. I was inspired by the author James Clear, whose book Atomic habits I am now reading (or actually listening to the audiobook from Audible.com) (<a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">jamesclear.com/atomic-habits</a>). I have decided to commit to writing blog posts in an attempt to force myself to reflect on what I have done and what I want to do next. Another reason is that this is an experiment in acquiring new habits. I have frequently tried to get new good habits and get rid of bad habits but more often than not failed. Atomic habits gave me a different way to look at changing my life. One of the points that has stuck with me is the idea that it isn’t setting high goals which determines whether one is able to achieve success, instead it is about making many tiny changes in your daily routine (habits), and that over time you will drift towards success. </p>
